# 9. Piracy

Pirates must follow their code.

    - [color=#ff0000]The safe zone rules still apply to pirates.[/color]
    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain, sentient pets and cyborgs.
    -- Round start pets (e.g. Clarrrpy) do not count towards this limit.
    - There may only be one Pirate Captain and one First Mate at any time.
    - Pirates may not operate without a First Mate or Captain present.
    -- If the leader of the pirates has been captured or killed, the remaining pirates may make efforts to rescue them.
    -- First Mates and Captains are required to open their job slot prior to going to cryo, or ahelp if this is not possible. Inform your crew of what they can do in your absence.
    - As a pirate, you must have LOOC permission before kidnapping and holding any civilian hostage.
    -- People kept hostage cannot be forced to do labor under any circumstance.
    - If a player surrenders, the plundering of their vessel must be kept to a reasonable level.
    -- Following escalation guidelines, if a player fights, then all goods on their ship are fair game. However, you must leave the ship in a state where it is able to fly (do not remove thrusters, power generation, shuttle console, crew console and all fuel).
    -- If you need to escape, then a player requiring medical attention can be left on a point of interest as a last resort. Do your best to keep them as far from death beforehand.
    -- If a player resumes combat after being revived, this can be taken as them accepting that they may have to respawn. In this case, they can be left to rot on a point of interest or left behind if saving them would compromise the safety of the pirate crew.
    - Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews. This includes:
    -- Watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack.
    -- Pretending to be hostages.
    -- Knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.
    -- Joining in pirate activity or becoming a pirate.
